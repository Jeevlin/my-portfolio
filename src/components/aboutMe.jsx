        I'm Jeevlin, a passionate full stack developer with a background in Electrical & Electronics Engineering.
        After stepping into tech, I found my strength in building responsive, dynamic web apps using JavaScript, 
        React, Node.js, Firebase, and MongoDB. Iâ€™ve built real-world projects like a theatre booking system, a pet store app with an admin panel, 
        and an academy admin app for student admissions.
        My goal is to craft clean, functional interfaces that solve real problems â€” always learning, always building.

        Fun fact: I debug best with a hot cup of coffee and soft music in the background â˜•ðŸŽ§
